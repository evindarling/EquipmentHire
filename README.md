# EquipmentHire

This is a web application designed to be used by staff members of a hypothetical equipment hiring company that hires out various equipment (leafblowers, lawnmowers, etc.) This was a group project assigned as part of the Project class of year 2 in Software Development.

Some functionality is missing from the webapp as I have only included that assigned to me - and have only uploaded code written by myself.
